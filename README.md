# ðŸ“§ Phishing Email Detection & Gmail Add-on  

ðŸ§  Overview
This project aims to detect phishing emails using both rule-based heuristics and a machine learning model, and to integrate the detection into Gmail via a Google Workspace Add-on. It enables users to scan an email with a click and receive a phishing classification.


# ðŸš€ Phishing Email Detection System 
âœ… Rule-based classification (suspicious links, misleading senders, urgent language).
âœ… Machine Learning model (Decision Tree) trained on a custom dataset.
âœ… Email parsing using Python's email module.
âœ… Classification output: Safe, Suspicious, or Phishing.

# Gmail Add-on 
âœ… UI button "Check Email" inside Gmail.
âœ… Sends email metadata (sender, subject, body) to the backend via HTTP POST.
âœ… Shows classification result inside Gmail UI.
âœ… Communicates with a Python Flask backend deployed externally (Render).

ðŸ“¬ Gmail Add-on Setup 
To integrate the classifier with Gmail:

1) Go to Google Apps Script and create a new project.
2) Paste the content of code.gs file + appsscript.json file (included in this repository).
3) Replace this placeholder line: 
const response = UrlFetchApp.fetch("https://your-server-url.com/classify", options) with your actual backend URL
4) Go to Deploy â†’ Test deployments
5) Set the deployment type to: Workspace Add-on with Gmail scope
6) Authorize the required permissions
7) Open Gmail, and you'll see the add-on in the right-hand panel.

"Scan for Phishing" button will send the content to your backend for classification.

# ðŸ“‰ Limitations
Doesnâ€™t handle attachments or embedded HTML parsing
Email classification model is trained on a small dataset (~100 examples)
No confidence score returned from the classification model


# ðŸŒ± Possible Improvements
Add confidence score
Add support for email header analysis and HTML body parsing.

# Installation & Setup
git clone https://github.com/DanaLeibu/EmailClassifier.git
cd EmailClassifier

pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
you can deploy the backend to services like Render, Railway, Heroku, AWS EC2
