ðŸ“§ Phishing Email Detection & Gmail Add-on

ðŸ§  Overview
This project aims to detect phishing emails using both rule-based heuristics and a machine learning model, and to integrate the detection into Gmail via a Google Workspace Add-on. It enables users to scan an email with a click and receive a phishing classification.



ðŸš€ Features
Phishing Email Detection System (Python)
âœ… Rule-based classification (suspicious links, misleading senders, urgent language).
âœ… Machine Learning model (Decision Tree) trained on a custom dataset.
âœ… Email parsing using Python's email module.
âœ… Classification output: Safe, Suspicious, or Phishing.

Gmail Add-on (Apps Script)
âœ… UI button "Check Email" inside Gmail.
âœ… Sends email metadata (sender, subject, body) to the backend via HTTP POST.
âœ… Shows classification result inside Gmail UI.
âœ… Communicates with a Python Flask backend deployed externally (Render).

ðŸ“¬ 2. Gmail Add-on Setup (Frontend)
To integrate the classifier with Gmail:

1) Go to Google Apps Script and create a new project.
2) Paste the content of your code.gs file (included in this repository).
3) Replace this placeholder line: 
const response = UrlFetchApp.fetch("https://your-server-url.com/classify", options) with your actual backend URL
4) Go to Deploy â†’ Test deployments or Deploy â†’ Add-on.
5) Set the deployment type to: Workspace Add-on with Gmail scope
6) Authorize the required permissions
7) Open Gmail, and you'll see the add-on in the right-hand panel.

"Check Email" button will send the content to your backend for classification.

ðŸ“‰ Limitations
Doesnâ€™t handle attachments or embedded HTML parsing
Email classification model is trained on a small dataset (~100 examples)
No confidence score returned from the classification model


ðŸŒ± Possible Improvements
Add confidence score
Add support for email header analysis and HTML body parsing.
